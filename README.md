## PRESENTATION
```
This work is made by anas and zakaria. It's an html5 2D game built with canevas and Javascript I got 
inspired from the early days video games (star wars).The PC version is fully available and running 
perfectly (it needs a server to run)
I personnally use NodeJs. Just to mention, I'm still working on devices and browsers compatibility 
(almost there)

A complete documentation will be available as soon as I finish the full version so stay tuned!
